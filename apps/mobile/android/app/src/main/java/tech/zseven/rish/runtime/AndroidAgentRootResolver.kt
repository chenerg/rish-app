/**
 * Turns a workspace binding into the root an agent attempt runs against.
 *
 * The evidence is this host's: which record the registry holds, whether its
 * authority still proves the directory on disk. The projection — what that
 * evidence entitles the root to — is the shared rule's
 * ([RishAgentCoreNative.agentRoot], `root_projection.rs`), so a root resolved
 * here carries exactly the capabilities the same evidence would carry on iOS.
 *
 * **Projects are not resolvable here.** A project root needs an independently
 * verified project lease, and Android has no project subsystem. A request that
 * names a `project_id` is refused rather than answered with a workspace root
 * wearing a project's name — the caller asked a question this platform cannot
 * answer, and saying so is the honest reply.
 *
 * **A root that cannot be proven is no root.** Not a read-only root, not a
 * stale one to be repaired: [resolve] returns null and the caller reports the
 * binding as stale.
