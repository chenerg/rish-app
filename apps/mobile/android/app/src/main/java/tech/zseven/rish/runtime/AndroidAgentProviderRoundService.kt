/**
 * `complete_agent_round_v2` on Android.
 *
 * Mirrors modules/rish/ios/Sources/AgentProviderRoundService.mm, whose pure
 * half is already `provider_round` in the shared core. That module names the
 * split: *the host keeps the transport, credentials, the tool registry's
 * native descriptors, the root projection validator, and the two provider
 * digests* -- the digests because they are taken with `NSJSONSerialization`
 * and sorted keys, a different byte protocol from the crate's canonical JSON,
 * so they are passed in as host facts rather than recomputed.
 *
 * The round is the step that asks the model what to do next. What it reads,
 * what the model is shown, how a reply becomes tool calls, and what the
 * journal records are all the core's; calling the provider and writing the
 * row are this file's.
 *
 * **Streaming is not here.** iOS shows a round's text as it arrives; this
 * waits for the whole reply. A round still completes and its calls are still
 * journalled; the only thing missing is watching it happen.
 *
 * Tools do travel, on the chat-completions protocol. What the model is shown
 * is the registry's description of each tool the root carries, and what comes
 * back is read by the core: turning untrusted model output into calls is
 * `completion_response`'s rule, and the transport carries the provider's reply
 * for it rather than reading it here.
