/**
 * The file work an agent does inside a workspace it is bound to.
 *
 * Mirrors modules/rish/ios/Sources/AgentWorkspaceToolExecutor.mm. Every rule is
 * the core's and asked for: which path components a tool argument may name, how
 * many bytes may be read, how a file revision is spelled. What is left here is
 * the mechanism -- opening, reading, writing, listing -- and the containment
 * that keeps all of it under one root.
 *
 * **Containment, and where it is weaker than iOS.** The core's path rule makes
 * an escape by `..` impossible: a component that is `.`, `..`, `.git` or
 * `.trash` is refused, and so is a leading slash, a backslash, a NUL, a
 * non-NFC spelling and any control or format character. That leaves symbolic
 * links, and iOS closes those with `openat` against a frozen root descriptor,
 * so the check and the open cannot disagree. Here the resolved path is compared
 * against the root's canonical path before the file is touched, which is a
 * check and then an open: a link swapped between the two would not be caught.
 *
 * That is sound for a workspace this app owns -- it lives under `filesDir`,
 * where nothing but this app can create anything, and the only writer is this
 * executor, which writes regular files. It stops being sound the day a folder
 * the person granted through the Storage Access Framework becomes a workspace
 * root, and that is the day this needs the descriptor discipline instead.
